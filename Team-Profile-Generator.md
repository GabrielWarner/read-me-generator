# Team-Profile-Generator



## Description
In this application I wrote the logic that asks the user a series of questions about their team names,roles, and info. The user is first asked to enter a Managers info and then asks the user if they want to add an engineer or intern. When they are done it will generate an HTML file with all of their info.
